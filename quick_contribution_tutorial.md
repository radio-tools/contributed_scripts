###I have some code. I just want to add it! How do I do that?

radioscripts_contrib is a collection of user-created radio astronomy python scripts. This code is offered with minimal vetting process and without any guarantee of reliability or accuracy. We encourage interested visitors to contribute by adding their own useful python routines. The radioscripts_contrib collection operates out of a Git Hub repository. Below is a very quick and very dirty tutorial on how to contribute your own code to the repository. This will not make you a Git master, but it will let you get the job done. If you're interested in a more in depth look at coordinating public contributed code in a nice controlled manner you may want to check out the Astropy tutorial on contributing code: http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/workflow/development_workflow.html

Briefly, here are the steps we'll be going through (if these don't make sense right now, don't worry we've got you covered below!): install and configure Git; create a personal fork of the radioscripts_contrib repository; clone your fork onto your machine; add your code as a new file in the appropriate directory; add, commit, and push your changes back onto your online repository; and finally do a pull request to ask moderators to merge the changes in your fork into the main version.


1. Get Git
   If you already know your way around Git you can skip down to step 2.

   1. If you don't already have an account, the first step is to go to github.com and set one up. 

   2. Next you need to make sure Git is installed on your computer. If you're working on a linux machine there's a good chance you already have it. To check, open a terminal and type

   ```
   git --version
   ```

   If git is installed you should see a message telling you what version you have. Something along these lines:

   ```
   git version 1.7.1
   ```

   If it's not installed head over to http://git-scm.com/downloads and download the version appropriate for your OS.

   3. You need to configure Git on your machine to let it know who you are. You can read through the Git guide on doing this here: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#set-up-git
But in the end this only requires two simple lines of 
typing in terminal:

   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   The Git guide also describes how to set up password caching (and there's the alternative of using SSH keys instead.) These steps are _generally_ only useful to save yourself time later from typing in a password when intereacting with your online Git repository. Don't worry about that unless you want to. _However,_ if you have git version 1.7.1 (as we do in this example,) you need to set up SSH keys.

   #####Extra special steps for those using git version 1.7.1
If you have a later version skip down to step 2.
For those of you working with git version 1.7.1, head over to https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys and follow along with their walkthrough and explanation of setting up an SSH key.

   After you've done that there's one more step of configuration. Open the file .git/config in your favorite text editor. It will look something like this:

   ```
   [core]
           repositoryformatversion = 0
           filemode = true
           bare = false
           logallrefupdates = true
   [remote "origin"]
           fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
           url = https://github.com/brisbind/radioscripts_contrib.git
   [branch "master"]
           remote = origin
           merge = refs/heads/master
   
   ```

   Change the url in the [remote "origin"] section:

   ```
   [core]
           repositoryformatversion = 0
           filemode = true
           bare = false
           logallrefupdates = true
   [remote "origin"]
           fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
           url = git@github.com:brisbind/radioscripts_contrib.git
   [branch "master"]
           remote = origin
           merge = refs/heads/master

   ```

   save and close the file.

2. Set up your personal version of radioscripts_contrib

   1. You need to create a "fork" of the radioscripts_contrib repository to have a personal version you can muck around with. From the online Git repository (https://github.com/radio-tools/radioscripts_contrib) click the button labelled "Fork" located near the upper right hand corner.

   2. You now need to create a "clone" (copy) of the radioscripts_contrib repository. Navigate to a path in terminal where you want to work and type:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/radioscripts_contrib.git
   ```

   3. This will create a subdirectory named radioscripts_contrib which contains the full repository. Within radioscripts_contrib/radioscripts_contrib/ scripts are organized into subfolders by topic. If there is a subfolder that describes the topic your script fits into, copy your code into that path (for instance, if you wrote a routine to fit spectral lines, this might belong under the spectralline path.) If no folder adequately describes the topic of your script, just copy it into the radioscripts_contrib/radioscripts_contrib/ path. We request that contributed code be prefaced with a two line license statement at the top:

   ```
   # Licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see LICENSE.rst
   # Copyright [authorname]
   ```

   We also request that you add a one or two line description of your code in the README file in the subdirectory where you place your code. 

   Note that if you're just trying this tutorial out to get the hang of it, there's a file named helloworld.py which you should feel free to edit.


3. Tell the online Git hub about your edited version of the repository

   1. At this point on your machine you should have a version of the radioscripts_contrib repository that is nearly identical to the one you started with, except with one or two new or edited files (the README file and your new script.)

   If you ask Git about your files by typing:

   ```
   git status
   ```

   Git will point out these new and edited files to you. You should get some lines of informational text along with the notice that you have "Untracked" files. These are the files which are newly updated since the last time you told Git about the important files you want to add. Along with the one or two files you actually care about there might be some junk files you don't care about (autosaved files ending in a ~ for instance.) It will look something like this:


   ```
   # On branch master
   # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
   #
   # Untracked files:
   #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
   #
   #	helloworld.py
   #       README.md
   #	helloworld.py~
   nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
   ```

      Stage the important files for uploading by typing

   ```
   git add your-first-file.name
   git add your-second-file.name
   ```

   Ask git about the status again:

   ```
   git status
   ```

   And you should now see your important files listed under "# Changes to be committed"

   2. You are now ready to commit these changes. As you do this include a brief message saying what changes you've made in your Git repository:

   ```
   git commit -m "Added my python script to fit spectral lines and updated README"
   ```

   3. Now you need to push this version of the repository back online:

   ```
   git push
   ```

   4. Almost done, now you just need to request to get your contributions merged into the main radioscripts_contrib repository by performing a "pull request". To do this, go back to your online forked version of the radioscripts_contrib repository. If you want to check, you can browse to the appropriate path and you should now see your newly added file(s). On the left side of the page, just above the list of files there is a green button with two arrows. Click it to go to a page that will summarize your changes and ask for a title. If all looks good then click the green button on that page and your pull request will be processed


You're done!
